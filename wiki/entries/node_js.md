Javascript implemented on all layers of the web (full-stack): client,server, and middleware.  It's major advantage is that the server does not use multi-threading so is more efficient.

node.js is an [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software "Open-source software"), [cross-platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform "Cross-platform"), [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript "JavaScript") runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a [web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser "Web browser"). Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for [server-side scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_scripting "Server-side scripting")—running scripts server-side to produce [dynamic web page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_web_page "Dynamic web page") content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js#cite_note-6) unifying [web-application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application "Web application") development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server- and client-side scripts.
