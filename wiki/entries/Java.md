a [class-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-based_programming "Class-based programming"), [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming "Object-oriented programming")  [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language") that is designed to have as few implementation [dependencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_(computer_science) "Dependency (computer science)") as possible. It is a [general-purpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_language "General-purpose language") programming language intended to let [application developers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_developer "Application developer")  _write once, run anywhere_ (WORA),[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)#cite_note-17) meaning that [compiled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler "Compiler") Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)#cite_note-design_goals-18) Java applications are typically compiled to [bytecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode "Java bytecode") that can run on any [Java virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine "Java virtual machine") (JVM) regardless of the underlying [computer architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture "Computer architecture"). The [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages) "Syntax (programming languages)") of [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(software_platform) "Java (software platform)") is similar to [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language) "C (programming language)") and [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B "C++"), but it has fewer [low-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language "Low-level programming language") facilities than either of them. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to [GitHub](http://127.0.0.1:8000/wiki/Git).
