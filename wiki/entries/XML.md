stands for **Ex**tensible **M**arkup **L**anguage, which defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human and machine-readable  HTML is actually a subset and implementation of XML. 

It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages. Although the design of XML focuses on documents, the language is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures[7] such as those used in web services.

In several studies, XML underperformed in comparison with JSON data
exchange format.  In
terms of both memory footprint as well as the parsing
runtime, JSON delivers better performance at the cost of
readability and flexibility.  

XML can be preferred instead of JSON as a data exchange format in the
following scenarios:
• Performance of the application is not the primary concern
• Memory footprint of an application can be
allowed to be large
• There needs to be strict adherence to a standard protocol for communication
